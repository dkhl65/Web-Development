# Web-Development

This is a collection of web development related files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The files in the Old Files folder were created when I was around 10 years old. The source files of my new website http://danielsoftware.herokuapp.com/ are in the Daniel-Software folder as well as https://github.com/dkhl65/danielsoftware.
