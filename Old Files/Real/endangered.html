<center><h1>Info on Endangered Animals</center></h1>
<p>It is important to save endangered animals, or they will disapear from earth forever. we don't want that to happen. Here are some details.
<p>Why Do Animals Become Endangered?
<p>Humans are largely responsible when animals become extinct, endangered or threatened. Here are some reasons why animals become endangered:
<h3>Pollution</h3>
Oil spills, acid rain and water pollution have been devastating for many species of fish and birds.Air pollution by cars and factories may cause animals to become endangered because animals need fresh air.. Even noise pollution from human activities can lead to the disruption of animal behavior. Some experts point to Navy sonar testing, which can alter migratory patterns of certain whales, as a possible explanation for groups of whales beaching themselves. Another cause of disease is human-introduced chemicals. The use of DDT and other pesticides is believed to have had a direct effect on bird populations. In fact, DDT poisoning is believed to be one of the leading factors in driving the California Condor to near extinction.
<h3>Destruction of Habitat</h3>
Humans destroy precious habitat which is the natural environment of a living thing when they fill swamps and marshes, dam rivers and cut down trees to build homes, roads and other developments. For example, commercial deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest has seriously reduced the population of many animal species and lead to the extinction of other groups. Land itself is a important resource to humans since it provides us with living space, and when people replace animal habitats with human habitats, it can lead to extensive loss of natural ranges for species. Due to water pollution, the baiji, a fresh water dolphin species native to China, was declared functionally extinct, meaning it’s unlikely the population can recover.
<h3>Exotic Species</h3>
When animals or plants arrive into a new habitat from a foreign place they sometimes introduce diseases that the native species can't fight. These "exotic" species can also prey on the native species. Species that are native to the environment may not have any defence against a new predator, and the effects can be devastating. In Australia, the introduction of the common house cat led to the extinction of the red-fronted parakeet and has seriously damaged the populations of several small mammals, including the bilby and the numbat.
<h3>Hunting and Fishing</h3>
Many animals are over-hunted because their meat, fur and other parts are very valuable. Experts believe that in the 1600s the passenger pigeon, an American bird, constituted between 25-40% of the bird population in the United States because there were no laws governing how many birds a hunter could kill, millions were hunted for meat over the next 300 years. In 1921, the last passenger pigeon died in captivity; the species’ extinction is believed to be due almost entirely to over-hunting. Commercial whaling led to near extinction of many species of whales before most, but not all, countries agreed to ban this practice.
<h3>Diseases</h3>
When animals become endangered, the entire food chain can be affected. Even the status of the smallest of animals can have a profound effect. For example, in 2008 disease seriously threatened the honeybee, which is largely responsible for pollinating flowering plants, including many fruits and vegetables. Without their pollination, an enormous part of the human diet could be decimated. In fact, should the honeybee become extinct, resulting economic and environmental costs are predicted to run into the billions of dollars. Therefore, many people argue that when animals become endangered it is in man's own self-interest to protect these animals.
